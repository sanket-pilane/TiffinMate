## 🏗️ Offline-First Architecture

To ensure reliability even with spotty internet, TiffinMate uses a robust **Repository Pattern**:

1.  **User Action**: You tap "Add Tiffin".
2.  **Local Write**: Data is **immediately** saved to **Hive** (Local DB). The UI updates instantly.
3.  **Background Sync**:
    - **Online**: Data is pushed to **Firebase Firestore** immediately.
    - **Offline**: Data is flagged as "unsynced".
    - **Reconnection**: A background worker automatically pushes pending changes when internet is restored.

  - **Secondary**: Soft Teal 💚 (For financial/success states).
  - **Background**: Clean Off-white / Deep Grey.
- **Animations**:
  - **Hero Animations**: Smooth transitions when expanding details.
  - **Confetti**: Celebrate when a bill is marked as "Paid" 🎉.
  - **Slide-to-Delete**: Intuitive gestures for management.
